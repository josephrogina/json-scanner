# json-scanner
The JSON Scanner currently scans a hard-coded URL for JSON data to sort and calculate the top 20.
I added it here to see about adding more functionality to it in the future.

ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Application built in Visual Studio 2015 with .NET Framework 4.5.2 

Currently, this project is still running the default VS Home page. Navigate to /Orders to load the scanner. (This obviously requires changing when this project gets under way.)
