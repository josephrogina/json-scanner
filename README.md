# json-scanner
The JSON Scanner currently scans a hard-coded URL for JSON data to sort and calculate the top 20.
I added it here to see about adding more functionality to it in the future.

Installation
-----------
```
Project should pull in required packages automatically. 
Built as an ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Application in Visual Studio 2015 with .NET Framework 4.5.2
```

Usage
-----
```
Currently, this project is still running the default VS Home page. Navigate to /Orders to load the scanner.
See "OrdersController.cs" for the actual JSON import and use code.
``` 

TODO
-------
The following is the beginning of a task list for this project.

* Clean up this README file.
* Refactor the classes used into something more useful.
* Go back through TODO's in code
